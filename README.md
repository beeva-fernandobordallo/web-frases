# Flame Stack

WIP - Main Documentation page is being built & project services still under development

Flame Stack is a 'glued-up' solution for speedy webApp development. As Ember enthusiasts we firmly bid on Tomster's framework for all our projects and this wasn't going to be any different. Backed up by Firebase and dabbed with a sweet touch of animations and material design, the Flame Stack calls at your door to become a useful tool when you want to prototype solutions or build small, rich apps in no time.

Tecnolog√≠as included in the Stack:
* Ember 2.0.0
* Ember Data 2.0.0
* Firebase
* Materialize
* Animate.css
* ember-cli-i18n
* jQuery 1.11

(LOOK AT THE 'Tutorial.md' file to see the steps followed to get this scaffold layed out.)
